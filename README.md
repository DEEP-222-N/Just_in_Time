# Just In Time ‚Äì Supply Chain Analytics
Unlocking efficiency in supply chain operations through data-driven insights

üè¢ About the Project

Just In Time is a supply chain analytics initiative designed to help businesses address real-world challenges in shipment tracking, inventory management, and demand forecasting.
The goal is to transform raw supply chain data into actionable insights that drive operational excellence and strategic decision-making.

üéØ What We Did

Analyzed historical shipment and inventory data to identify inefficiencies.

Segmented inventory based on demand patterns to improve planning accuracy.

Designed dashboards to empower stakeholders with real-time visibility.

Recommended strategies to restore revenue streams and prevent future disruptions.

üë• Stakeholders Impacted

Sales Managers ‚Äì Better forecasting for customer demand and product sales.

Inventory Managers ‚Äì Enhanced visibility on stock flow and fulfillment rates.

Shipping Managers ‚Äì Improved on-time delivery and reduced logistics costs.

üß† Tech & Tools

Python ‚Äì Data preprocessing, EDA, and segmentation analysis

Pandas & Matplotlib ‚Äì Data cleaning and visualization

Jupyter Notebooks ‚Äì End-to-end data analytics workflow

üìä Key Outcomes

Identified high-value inventory segments driving major revenue.

Proposed a supply chain redesign to eliminate repeat disruptions.

Delivered dashboards and metrics for continuous monitoring.

## **SUGGESTIONS**

**1. Sharp decline in revenue and profit:** The most likely root cause of business downturn comes from a supply chain disruption on the supplier network such as delays in sourcing, transportation, distribution or problem with suppliers could have affected the company's ability to replenish the warehouse inventory promptly, especially for the products of XA and YA segments.

**2. Overstock and Understock:** The company often encounters overstock situation, causing excess inventory and wasting storage costs. Sometimes the company is also understocked. This shows that inventory management is not really implemented effectively yet

**3. High late shipment rate:** The company has a rather concerning late shipment rate (30 - 50%) which related to the delivery system

## **Recommendations**

##1. Restore Revenue and Profit (by inventory segmentation):

XA, YA:
These two segments have always shown strong customer demand and have been key revenue drivers. Getting them back on track should be a top priority. To do this, the company should work on finding reliable alternative suppliers and redesigning the supply chain to prevent disruptions like the one in Q4/2017.

It‚Äôs important to analyze where exactly the supply chain broke down and source from suitable regions. For example, apparel products typically come from Southeast Asia, West Asia, and Central America, while electronics often come from North America and East Asia. Pinpointing the disruption source will help ensure a smoother supply chain in the future.

XB, XC:
These segments have shown promising growth potential, especially during the disruption period when they carried most of the company‚Äôs revenue. The next step should be to conduct thorough market research to understand current consumption patterns and emerging trends, both locally and globally.

Keeping an eye on how these segments evolve and forecasting demand will help in optimizing inventory and tapping into potential opportunities.

YB, YC, ZB, ZC:
These segments contribute very little to revenue and face low demand. It would be wise to either discontinue them or significantly reduce inventory levels to cut down storage costs.

##2. Managing Overstock and Understock:

If demand forecasting tools are available, they should be used to analyze past sales data, market trends, and customer demand patterns. Predictive analytics can help maintain the right inventory balance‚Äîavoiding both stockouts and excess inventory.

Setting up reorder points based on lead times, sales velocity, and safety stock will ensure timely restocking. Maintaining a safety stock buffer is especially important to handle unexpected demand surges or supply delays while minimizing excess storage costs.

Since customer demand varies by region‚Äîlike Asia Pacific peaking in Q4/2017 and Europe earlier‚Äîthe company should use this historical cycle to plan inventory levels for each region more accurately. For example, Asia Pacific might dominate in Q1/2018, followed by North America in later quarters.

##3. Reducing Late Shipment Rates:

To bring down late shipments, the company should adopt a multi-step strategy:

Redesign transportation routes using methods like cross-docking to streamline the shipping process.

Partner with local logistics companies in distant markets to leverage their expertise and infrastructure.

Establish a warehouse in a strategic hub like Singapore for the Asian market. This will speed up deliveries, cut shipping times, and support global expansion efforts.
